       Selector Cafe was started by coffee lovers and coders who wanted to combine two great passions - coffee and technology.
       Our goal is to create a place where creativity flows as freely as freshly brewed coffee.
       We believe that every cup tells a story, and with us, that story is written with love and caffeine.
